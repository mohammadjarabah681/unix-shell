The shell can handle both built-in commands and executable files. It is not sophisticated as Bash or Zsh, but it performs similar functions.\n\nThe codebase is pretty organized, easier to maintain, and scalable as the project grows (if that happened) due to the clean file structure, clean code, and great documentation. This has been be done with modularity, best practices, documentation, documentation strings, type hinting, and unit testing, which made the codebase easier to debug and maintain, as well as, ensured code correctness."
