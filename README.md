## Overview
A simple version of UNIX Shell developed using Python programming language and Pytest framework, under a Linux environment, with several awesome [open-source technologies](#technologies). The shell can handle both [built-in commands](#shell-commands) and executable files. It is not sophisticated as *Bash* or *Zsh*, but it performs similar functions.

The codebase is pretty organized, easier to maintain, and scalable as the project grows (if that happened) due to the clean file structure, clean code, and great documentation. This has been be done with modularity, best practices, documentation, documentation strings, type hinting, and unit testing, which made the codebase easier to debug and maintain, as well as, ensured code correctness.

## Setup
After cloning this repository, you should following this step-by-step instructions to setup the production environment and run the application locally on your machine.

### I. Prerequisites
1. Update and upgrade packages.
    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

1. Install `Python 3.10` interpreter.
    ```sh
    sudo apt install python3.10
    ```

1. Install `python3.10-venv` package.
    ```sh
    sudo apt install python3.10-venv
    ```

### II. Creating Virtual Environment
1. Navigate to the project's root directory.

1. Create a virtual environment.
    ```sh
    python3.10 -m venv .venv
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment.
    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install production dependencies.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### III. Running Shell Application
1. Make the `app.py` file executable.
    ```sh
    chmod +x app.py
    ```

1. Run the shell application.
    ```sh
    ./app.py
    ```

### IV. Exiting Shell Application
1. Simply close the terminal window or use the `exit` command to exit the terminal session.
    ```sh
    exit
    ```

1. Deactivate the virtual environment.
    ```sh
    deactivate
    ```

## Tests
This project uses [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) for unit testing. Follow the steps below to run the tests.

1. Navigate to the project's root directory, and activate the virtual environment.
    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install development dependencies.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

1. Run Pytest with basic verbosity on details.
    ```sh
    pytest -v
    ```

1. After the tests finished, deactivate the virtual environment.
    ```sh
    deactivate
    ```
